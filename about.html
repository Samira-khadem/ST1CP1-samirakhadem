        <h1>Early life</h1>
        <p>
            His parents enrolled him at the Lakeside School, a rigorous Seattle private high school that future
            Microsoft cofounder Paul Allen also attended. Gates often credits his discovery of computers to the tools he
            gained at Lakeside. "The experience and insight Paul Allen and I gained here gave us the confidence to start
            a company based on this wild idea that nobody else agreed with — that computer chips were going to become so
            powerful that computers and software would become a tool that would be on every desk and in every home," he
            said in a 2005 speech at the school.
        </p>
        <p>
            After graduating from Lakeside in 1973, Gates headed to Harvard. Though he entered as a pre-law major, he
            soon changed course and quickly worked his way through the university's upper-level math and computer
            science classes.
